Description: We extend a widely used ordinal regression model, the cumulative probability model (CPM), to fit clustered continuous response variables based on generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods for ordinal responses. With our approaches, estimates of marginal parameters, cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), expectations, and quantiles conditional on covariates can be obtained without pre-transformation of the potentially skewed continuous response data.
